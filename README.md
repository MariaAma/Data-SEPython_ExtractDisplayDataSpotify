# Spotify Audio Features Analysis with Spotipy
This project leverages the Spotipy library to analyze the audio features of the last 50 songs a user has listened to on Spotify. By extracting data such as danceability, energy, and valence, it aims to provide insights into the user's music preferences and mood based on their recent listening history.

# Key Features:
Data Retrieval: Utilize Spotipy to fetch the user's recently played tracks from Spotify.
Audio Feature Extraction: Extract essential audio features including danceability, energy, and valence for each track.
Interactive Web Application: Utilize Streamlit to develop an interactive web application for visualizing the extracted audio features on dynamic bar charts.
Personalized Insights: Provide users with insights into their music listening habits and preferences based on the characteristics of the songs they've recently listened to.

# Technologies Used:
Python: Used for data retrieval and visualization.
Spotipy: Python library for interacting with the Spotify Web API.
